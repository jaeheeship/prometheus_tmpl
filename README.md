## Features

Prometheus's main features are:

* a multi-dimensional data model (time series identified by metric name and key/value pairs)
* a flexible query language to leverage this dimensionality
* no reliance on distributed storage; single server nodes are autonomous
* time series collection happens via a pull model over HTTP
* pushing time series is supported via an intermediary gateway
* targets are discovered via service discovery or static configuration
* multiple modes of graphing and dashboarding support
